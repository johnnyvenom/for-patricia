## Meeting 19-Jan with MIREVA (Chris, Chris, Ben, Ivana)

Discussed pipeline: mocap > avatar; segments that can be sequenced and interpolated in real time. 

Discussed two sets of operations on the avatar (sent from AI output). These instructions could be sent synchronously or asynchronously. 

1. Sequencing of the sections (eg., at the end of section X next section is Z)
2. Applying variations to the choreography (also music): reverse, inverse, faster/slower, etc.

We also talked about the visual layer of the "visual score" elements, TBD... 

Questions: 
- One avatar or two? We have said 1 but would it make sense to try two, if the choreo is for two. It's possible but more difficult. 
- What should the avatar look like? Humanoid, but then what? Speaks to bigger question about the visual aesthetic of the piece.
