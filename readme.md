## About "For Patricia"

“For Patricia” is a dance piece where the choreographic and musical composition is generated in real-time with AI and through audience interaction. The piece is an ode to postmodernism in Dance. “For Patricia”, or for Trisha, is in honor of one of the inventors of postmodernism Trisha Brown. Expanding on the legacy of Brown and other postmodern dancers and composers like Merce Cunningham and John Cage, the piece will use simple musical and choreographic patterns based on sound recordings and everyday gestures and explore ways in which we can compose with these patterns based on complex structures generated through AI and modified through audience interaction. “For Patricia” is realized onstage as a quartet between two dancers (Sarah Fdili-Alaoui and Bartek Ostrowski) and two musicians (John Sullivan and Léo Chédin).

The 8-week MODINA residency for the development of this project will take place at CNDB, Bucharest, between 15/1/2024 and 10/3/2024. It will culminate with an artist talk and a public showing (dates TBD).
